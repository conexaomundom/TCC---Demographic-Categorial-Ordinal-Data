ABSTRACT

Observing statistics from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE),
we know that in 2019 women received 77.7% (about 3/4) of men’s salary, while the average
monthly salary of men was R$2, 555, 00, the women’s was R$1, 985.00. Therefore, it is
extremely important to analyze whether this salary difference between the sexes is present
in the state of Para´ıba and how much this difference influences the worker’s salary. Using
regression models, regression models for categorical data, which have an ordinal nature,
it can be seen that in all models tested the variable Sex was significant and the coefficient
estimate was negative, as the reference category is being of male sex, then being female
negatively influences the Average Salary. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is a
salary difference between the sexes in the state of Para´ıba, the average salary for women
is 0.5951 times the average salary for men.
